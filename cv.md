## **Briefly About Me:**

After working as an international project lawyer for 5 years, I realized that my true passion lies in influencing the outcome of a project rather than just documenting it formally.

With this realization, I decided to explore various IT fields and ultimately chose front-end development as the most captivating career, offering limitless opportunities for professional growth and leveraging high-quality, free resources for self-education.

To my surprise, I discovered many commonalities between front-end development and my legal background. Both require continuous learning, attention to detail, logical thinking, and a commitment to delivering high-quality work.
